This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

<h2>Simple Rnotebook for plotting variables Using ggplot2 and grid Extra</h2> 
<p>
The data set used is relatively small with only 23 observations over 5 vars but techniques will work even with larger data set 
</p>


```{r}
#importing library 
##data set used is not very big but the operations works with big data  as well just need to adjust graphs etc using s
library(alr3)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gridExtra)



```
```{r}
#importing Data
#list.files()
co2 <- read.csv('indiaco2.csv' , sep = ',')
head(co2)


#adding simple plots using grid extra to display them side by side

p1 <- ggplot(aes(Year,GHG) , data = co2) +
  geom_line( color ='red' )
p2 <- ggplot(aes(Year,rain) , data = co2) +
  geom_line( color ='green' )
p3 <- ggplot(aes(Year, CO2) , data = co2) +
  geom_line( color ='orange' )


grid.arrange(p1 , p2, p3 ,ncol = 1)


# facet wrap to give data year wise
ggplot(aes(rain, CO2) , data = co2) +
  geom_point()+
  facet_wrap(~Year)



```
## Corelations
```{r}
?cor.test #for documentation
cor.test(co2$Year , co2$GHG) # high +ve corelation ie =0.972
cor.test(co2$Year , co2$rain) #  -ve corelation ie = -0.480 year inc then rain dec
cor.test(co2$CO2 , co2$GHG) # high +ve corelation ie =0.999 because co2 is a part of green housegases (GHG).
cor.test(co2$GHG , co2$rain) # high -ve corelation ie = -0.444




```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
